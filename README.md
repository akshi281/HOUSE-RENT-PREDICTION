# House Price Prediction

### Project Overview

→ House Price Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts the price of a house based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property details.

→ This project helps buyers and sellers estimate property prices using data-driven insights.

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

→  Analyze housing dataset

→  Identify important features affecting house prices

→  Build a predictive model

→  Predict house prices accurately

### Technologies Used

→  Python

→  Pandas

→  NumPy

→  Matplotlib

→  Scikit-learn

→  Streamlit

### Algorithm Used
→  Linear Regression
→  Machine Learning Regression Model

### How to Run the Project

##### 1. Install required libraries:
   
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit


##### 3. Run the Streamlit app:

 streamlit run app.py

##### 5. LINKS
