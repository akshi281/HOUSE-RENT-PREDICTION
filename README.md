House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Overview

→ House Price Prediction is a Machine Learning project that predicts the price of a house based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other property details.

→ The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices accurately to help buyers, sellers, and real estate businesses make informed decisions.

Problem Statement:

Real estate prices vary depending on multiple factors.
Manually estimating the correct price is difficult and often inaccurate.

This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to:

→ Analyze historical housing data

→ Identify important price-influencing factors

→ Predict house prices with high accuracy

Machine Learning Workflow:

→ Data Collection

→ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

→ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

→ Feature Engineering

→ Model Training

→ Model Evaluation

→ Prediction

Algorithms Used:

→ Linear Regression

→ Random Forest Regressor

→ Decision Tree Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:

→ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

→ Mean Squared Error (MSE)

→ R² Score

Technologies Used:

→ Python

→ Pandas

→ NumPy

→ Scikit-learn

→ Matplotlib

→ Seaborn

→ Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab / VS code

→ Streamlit / Flask (if deployed)


Results:

→ The model successfully predicts house prices based on input features and provides accurate estimates with good R² score.
